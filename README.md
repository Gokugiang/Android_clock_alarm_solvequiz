## App origin
Android app  Alarm clock solving quiz to turn off the ringtone. 
This app is for the subject 
* Instructor: KhangPQ3
* Course: Mobile Programming(PRM392)
* Project grades: 9+/10 (4.7/5 for code)
* Note : I am not responsible if you accidentally download the app and accidentally present to Khang sensei and eventually got 0 :) 

## Self - intro
I am GiangDV
and I am one of  the main developers of the app. 
The idea of creating the app was given by me because I wanted to make an app which could help students who meet difficulties in waking up from beautiful dreams like me. 
I am responsible for these parts: Designing the interface (80%), Database (Delete task function), Select sound function, Read file function, Work with permission.
And also participate in solving problems and fixing bugs of all functions.
The app was not perfect and not ready to be present in CH Play.
Therefore, after the subject , I decided to upload it here and develop myself some more features to complete the app. 

The promising features I gonna develop are 
1. User package adding (Allow the user to upload their own language package)
2. Fix notification service which allows users to receive the app even when they slide off the app tab
3. Transform the add button on the main screen to a menu
4. Work with music (Add user music)

Have a good day !
